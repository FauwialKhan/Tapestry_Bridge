# Tapestry_Bridge
 
An R program that connects the unsuppressed 'year' from PgAdmin4 (PostgreSQL Client) to 'R'. It will create a queryable data frame in R for Total ownership of all counties at the NAICS6 Level. 

You will require:

- PgAdmin4 
- PostgreSQL
- Rstudio 
- Login Credentials for the PgAdmin4 server (NKN_Taprestry_DataWarehouse)

Packages for the program’s smooth running will be in the R code itself. 

# Since the program requires a ‘year’ for which the data frame will be created. That is the key input for successful execution. 

As a brief, this is all that is currently required. The RMD (R Markdown) file will further describe the programs working.
